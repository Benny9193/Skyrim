## Project Context

This repository contains:
- **3D Reconstruction Studio** (`index.html`) - Upload and process images/videos into 3D models
- **Skyrim Bestiary Viewer** (`character.html`, `bestiary.html`) - Interactive creature encyclopedia
- **Character Database** (`characters.json`) - JSON data for 10+ creatures

I understand the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim lore, creature types, game mechanics, and can help maintain accuracy while implementing new features.
